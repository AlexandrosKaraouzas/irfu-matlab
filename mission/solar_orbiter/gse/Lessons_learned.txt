Lessons learned that can be used in Solar Orbiter
=================================================

Data cdf files
--------------
1	Use TT2000 time	Precision is nanoseconds. 
	If it is sufficient precision for all RPW instruments, then it is preferable instead of CDF EPOCH16 which is two numbers.
2	Use variable names that are unique across all Solar Orbiter mission.	
	For example in Cluster Active Archive variable name includes dataset name and also data prodcut level where necessary. Example: E_Vec_xyz_GSE__C4_CP_EFW_L2_E3D_GSE
3	Do not use minus signs '-' inside the names of variables or datasets.
	MATLAB does not like minus signs in variable names and therefore all minus signs have to be converted to underscores. Better avoid minus signs alltogether. 
4	Use variable names less than 63 characters.	
	Limitation in cdf???
5	Use the same vocabulary everywhere.
	For example in CAA one uses 'datasets' (not data products).
6	Distinguish zeros from data gaps/NaNs.	
7	For time strings use ISO formatted time.
	e.g. 2014-03-30T08:01:15.084297Z  (comma after seconds is optional and 
there can be any number of digits behind comma) 
8	The same information should be kept in one location only.
	Other instances should refer to that location. For example, in Cluster, spacecraft position was also kept in the file of magnetometer data which just wastes disk space and at the end it appeared also has less precision than needed.
