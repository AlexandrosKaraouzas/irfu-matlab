This package contains reusable general-purpose library code written by Erik P G Johansson, hence the package name. It is effectively a MIRROR of a subset of Erik P G Johansson's otherwise "personal" code. It is included since it is used by Solar Orbiter/RPW code authored by Erik P G Johansson in the irfu-matlab git repo. 

WARNING: THIS CODE IS NOT INTENDED TO BE USED BY OTHERS OR USED FOR OTHER REASONS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

WARNING: The author sometimes UNILATERALLY DECIDES TO MAKE BACKWARD-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES, OR REMOVE CODE WITHOUT WARNING.

NOTE: Might not include existing automatic test code for all code found here.
