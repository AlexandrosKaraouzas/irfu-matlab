This package contains reusable general-purpose library code written by Erik P G Johansson, hence the package name. It is effectively a MIRROR of a subset of Erik P G Johansson's otherwise "personal" code. It is included since it is used by Solar Orbiter/RPW code authored by Erik P G Johansson in the irfu-matlab git repo. 

This code is not primarily meant to be used by others or used for other reasons. It is possible that some of this code will/should at some point be transferred to a more conventional irfu-matlab package.

WARNING: The author sometimes UNILATERALLY DECIDES TO MAKE BACKWARD-INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES, OR REMOVE CODE WITHOUT WARNING.
