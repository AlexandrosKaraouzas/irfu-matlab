# Author: Erik P G Johansson, IRF-U, Uppsala, Sweden
# First created 2016-04-xx
#
# The primary purpose of this bash script is to call a MATLAB script.
# See readme.txt for more information on arguments.
# See the MATLAB script called for more documentation.
#
#
#
# NOTE: The script is designed to handle important basic errors, such as
# 1) Can not find MATLAB executable (not explicitly, but implicitly)
# 2) MATLAB can not find the MATLAB script.
# 
# NOTE: The script is designed to return the same exit codes as the MATLAB code.
# 
# NOTE: The script reads the "--log" parameter value and pipes "all" stdout to a log file. 
# It also uses a prefix to filter out some stdout lines that are piped to the actual stdout.
# In addition, a symlink (with a constant filename) to the current log file is created.
# Overwriting the old symlink might technically not be compliant with the RCS ICD.
# 
# NOTE: The script takes stderr and copy it to the log file with a prefix.
# 
# 
# 
# IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: Reasons to pipe MATLAB's stdout to the log file
# from this bash script rather than from MATLAB code:
# 1) avoid manually having to pipe everything to log file in MATLAB code.
# 2) can handle stdout from library MATLAB code that prints to stdout (code that should not be altered, e.g. in irfu-matlab, e.g. irf.log)
# 3) can handle stdout from the MATLAB startup process
# 
# IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: The same arguments that are passed to this script are passed on to the MATLAB code, including
# arguments which are unnecessary there, including --log <dir> and --config <file>.
# PRO (Reasons for):
# 1) It is best to let as much parameter-parsing (incl. syntax checking) code to be in one place as possible (the MATLAB code).
# 2) Enable the MATLAB code to print all the command-line parameters in error messages and to the log file.
# 3) Enable the MATLAB code to print its syntax which is then identical to the syntax of this script.
# CON: The MATLAB code needs some knowledge of the parameter parsing in this script.
#
# IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: The name of this file may only contain alphanumeric characters. Can therefore not use 
# the file extension ".sh" to indicate that it is a shell script.

#====================================================================================================
# QUESTION: If log file already exists, overwrite, amend, or error?
# PROPOSAL: Better error message when can not find MATLAB_COMMAND. Common error.
# PROPOSAL: Detect presence of bicas within irfu-matlab (avoid there being two bicas).
#
# TODO?: Detect root path from new environment variable specified in new/upcoming RCS ICD.
#
# BUG: If mistakenly uses bad "--config" flag, i.e. "--conf", then the script itself will use the wrong
# MATLAB version ==> Can not launch MATLAB (which would have checked if "--conf" was a bad flag).
