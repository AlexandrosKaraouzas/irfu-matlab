BICAS = BIAS Calibration Software



This software, BICAS, is created for the calibration of the hardware BIAS, a component in the RPW instrument on the Solar Orbiter spacecraft.
The principle author of this software is Erik P G Johansson, IRF-U, Uppsala, Sweden. Software development began 2016-03-xx.

IMPORTANT NOTE: BICAS is designed to comply with the RCS ICD. Much documentation on how to use this software can thus be found there. The documentation here only covers the most important information covered in the RCS ICD.



=======================
 ACRONYMS / DICTIONARY
=======================
RCS            = RPW Calibration Software. BICAS is an example of an RCS.
ICD            = Interface Control Document
RCS ICD        = Shorthand for the document ROC-TST-GSE-ICD-00023-LES, "RPW Calibration Software ICD Documentation".
S/W mode       = Mode which defines a set of required input CDF files and a set of output CDF files derived from the input files.
                 BICAS can execute only one such mode on each run. Executing such modes is the primary purpose of an RCS.
S/W descriptor = Text on JSON format which describes among other things the S/W modes, including the required CLI parameters albeit not very clearly.



=======================
SYNTAX / CLI PARAMETERS
=======================
NOTE: The official CLI parameter syntax is defined in RCS ICD, Iss02 Rev02, Section 3.2.

SYNTAX 1: ( --identification | --version | --help ) <General parameters>
SYNTAX 2: <S/W mode> <General parameters, Output parameter, Specific inputs parameters> 

NOTE: Only the position of the first parameter is important.


--version           Prints the software version.
--identification    Prints the S/W descriptor.
--help

General parameters
   --log    <absolute path to directory>   (optional) Specifies directory in which to put log files.
   --config <absolute path to file>        (optional) Specifies the configuration file to use.

<S/W mode>   Selects the S/W mode to use.
   
Specific input parameters
    Set of parameters which specify input CDF files. The exact set depends on the exact S/W mode.

Output parameter
   --log    <absolute path to directory>   Specifies the directory in which to put output CDF files.

   
   
========================================
 S/W descriptor, roc_sw_descriptor.json
========================================
The S/W descriptor and the file "roc_sw_descriptor.json" are specified by the RCS ICD.
The file "roc_sw_descriptor.json" should contain the S/W descriptor. The file is NOT meant to be edited manually.
If BICAS has been updated in such a way that the software descriptor changes, then a new "roc_sw_descriptor.json" can be generated by piping the stdout from "bicas --identification" to a file.
