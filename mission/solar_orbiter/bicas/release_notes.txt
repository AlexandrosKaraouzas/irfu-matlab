Release notes
=============


Version 1.0.0
-------------
Almost-complete support for LFR & TDS datasets (voltages) with transfer
functions (partially tested). No parasitic capacitance.


Version 2.0.0
-------------
Added support for L1 input bias current datasets; supports updated L1R input
datasets, and updated L2 master CDFs (V08).


Version 2.0.1
-------------
Bugfix: Reads bias current zVars as nA (not uA)


Version 3.0.0
-------------
Functionality for ITF high freq. cutoff.
Uses master CDFs V09 (instead of V08).
Copies zVar BW from LFR datasets.
Searches for BIAS RCT using other filenaming scheme: *RPW-BIAS*.
L2 bias current in nA (not ampere).
Uses LFR mux mode.
