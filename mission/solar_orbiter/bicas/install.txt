How to extract the ROC ICD-compliant software from the irfu-matlab git repository
==================================================================================
Context:
--------
(1) The ROC-OPS-PIP-NTT-00008-LES iss01rev01 (and maybe ROC-TST-GSE-ICD-00023-LES iss02rev02)
    requires BICAS to have a certain directory structure, or at least where the start script should be (bicas/roc/).
(2) BICAS is a subset of the irfu-matlab git repository (IRF-U, Uppsala, Sweden) and irfu-matlab
    requires BICAS to be in a certain subdirectory within it.
(3) When BICAS is a part of irfu-matlab, BICAS uses irfu-matlab function files located outside of BICAS' own subdirectories.
Therefore one can NEITHER (1) just copy all of irfu-matlab to the location where BICAS is
to be run, NOR (2) just copy the BICAS subdirectory from within irfu-matlab.


Procedure in principle:
-----------------------
(1) Use bicas/ as a root directory and put the remainder of irfu-matlab/ under bicas/lib/.

Example using copying:
   cp -r   ~/irfu-matlab/mission/solar_orbiter/bicas   ~/
   cp -r   ~/irfu-matlab   ~/bicas/lib/
   rm -r   ~/bicas/lib/irfu-matlab/mission/solar_orbiter/bicas   ~/bicas/lib/irfu-matlab/.git/

Note: This procedure is really just meant to show the setup one wants to achieve.
Note: BICAS is designed to run using both directory configurations. When it runs in the irfu-matlab
configuration it might require additional flags.

(2) Add master cdf files for every dataset that the software can produce to the data/ subdirectory if
not included already. Master cdf files must have standard filenames, i.e. on the form
<Dataset ID>_<Version string>.cdf, where version string is on the form Vxx, x=digit.
The datasets and versions must be correct, i.e. in agreement with the S/W descriptor.
