Quality flags are on a 1 minute cadence, 
identifying intervals where instrument or spacecraft activities 
can affect the measurements.  0 signifies the absence of any flags. 

FIELDS quality flags. This is a bitwise variable, 
meaning that multiple flags can be set for a single time, 
by adding flag values. 

Current flagged values are: 
1: FIELDS antenna bias sweep, 
2: PSP thruster firing, 
4: SCM Calibration, 
8: PSP rotations for MAG calibration (MAG rolls), 
16: FIELDS MAG calibration sequence, 
32: SWEAP SPC in electron mode, 
64: PSP Solar limb sensor (SLS) test. 
128: PSP spacecraft is off umbra pointing. 

A value of zero corresponds to no set flags. 
Not all flags are relevant to all FIELDS data products, 
refer to notes in the CDF metadata and on the FIELDS SOC 
website for information on how the various flags impact 
FIELDS data. Additional flagged items may be added in the future.

Differential Energy Flux vs Energy/angle bin
The units are differential energy flux and eV.
The “sf1” product is an energy spectrum produced on the spacecraft by summing over the theta and phi directions. 
CAVEAT:The larger theta angles (deflection angles) are artificially enhanced in the “sf1” energy spectra data products due to the method of spectra production on the SPAN-E instrument (straight summing). Thus, SF1 energy spectra are not recommended for rigid statistical analysis.

The strongest signal peak, which generally corresponds to the bulk proton

the temperature tensor.This is a most probable thermal speed,
