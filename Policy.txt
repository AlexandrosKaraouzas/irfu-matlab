Writing code for irfu-matlab
============================

Coding style
------------
1. According to http://www.datatool.com/prod02.htm
2. Help follows matlab style, see irf_template

Git
---
1. Workflow according to http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
2. Routines in 'master' branch should do not less and not more than written in their help!
3. Semantic release numbering http://semver.org/

Common data types
-----------------
DataObject     - the same as dataset in CAA, equal to cdf file representation in matlab
VariableStruct - Structure including all variable data in original format and metadata,
                 usually extracted from DataObject.
VariableIrf    - Variable as a simple structure in a default format for irfu-matlab
                 Variable.t - TimeArray
                 Variable.[data] - data matrix of dimension [t x dim1 x dim2]... (typical example energy spectrograms)
                 Variable.[unit,label,dimunit,dimlabel,dimvec]
                 Variable.[vec] - data matrix of dimension [t x ndim], (for example ndim=3 for field vector)
                 Variable.[abs] - absolute value of vector in case exists Variable.vec
VariableMat    - matrix where first column is time and the other columns are data [DEPRECATED]

Time
----
The following time types are to be used:
1. UNIX epoch
2. CDF epoch
3. CDF epoch16
4. CDF epoch TT2000
