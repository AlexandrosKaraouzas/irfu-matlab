Affected file: cefReadData.c
	
	Fixed a couple of bugs in cefReadData.c. 
	It reduces the array size when reading gzipped files with less then 
	30 records. It also reallocates, expanding with 60 records, at the time
	when mean estimation of number of records is not very accurate.
	
Affected files: cefTimeToMjs.c, cefMjsToTime.c

        Fixed a minor bug in the handling of fraction part of second.
	It can store down to nanoseconds now but the fraction resolution
	will decrease as number of whole seconds increase.
